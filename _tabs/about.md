# About TypingPenguin

Welcome to TypingPenguin, a personal space where I document a random collection of my thoughts, short tutorials and projects. As a Master’s student in Computer Science and Industrial Design Engineering, I often play around with various tech and I want to document it for future me. This blog serves as a way for me to keep track of solutions and ideas that might come in handy in the future, and hopefully, one day, help another poor soul that is struggling with the same issues.

Here, you’ll find a mix of stuff and occasional tutorials that reflect my learning journey. The content is intentionally low effort and sporadically updated, driven by my whims and current interests, and definitely not because of my incredibly short attention span. It’s less about polished articles and more about capturing useful nuggets of knowledge as they come.

The tech you can expect to be discussed mostly involve IoT, 3D printers, Software and any other stuff I get my hands on. If you have any cool stuff that you want me to look into, don't hesitate to contact me!

Feel free to browse through and see if anything resonates with your own tech or design challenges. For any questions or collaboration inquiries, you can reach me by email (see the icon at the bottom left).

Thanks for stopping by, and enjoy your time on TypingPenguin!
